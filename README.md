# Data Validation

Introduction: 
Prober is a specialized web application designed to enhance data analysis and management processes. 
This platform caters to developers, analysts, and administrators, providing a streamlined interface for data exploration,
user management, and role based access control. Users can effortlessly interact with various databases, execute
complex queries, and perform data validation, making Data Prober an essential tool for professionals who deal
with large datasets and require precise data handling.

Aim: 
Data Prober is an intuitive and user-friendly tool that allows users, regardless of their technical expertise,
to effectively analyze, validate, and manage database content. The tool will make it easy for users to add , delete 
and update the data as well as find and fix missing or incorrect data.

Objectives: 
1.User Empowerment:
Empower non-technical users to perform complex data tasks independent.

2.Improved Data Quality:Ensure higher data quality by providing tools for thorough data validation and correction.

3.To enable users to add,delete and update data without writing SQL queries.

Problem Statement:
Many people struggle with databases because they don't know how to write complex queries. 
This makes it hard for them to check, update, or correct data. 

This barrier limits their ability to perform essential data validation tasks, such as detecting
missing (null) or incorrect (zero) values, adding or updating records, and analyzing data patterns.

Tools and technologies used:
1.Spring Boot: Utilized to develop the backend of the application, providing a robust framework for building
Java based web applications. It simplifies the configuration and deployment of backend services.

2.Spring Data JPA: Implemented for data access, allowing seamless interaction with the MySQL or
PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve user data, roles, and other related information efficiently.

3.Spring Web: Used for handling web requests and responses, managing controllers, and serving static
resources to the frontend. It also handles the routing and processing of HTTP requests in the application

4.Axios: Used as a client side HTTP library for making asynchronous HTTP requests from the frontend
(React. to the backend (Spring Boot). It simplifies API calls, data fetching, and interactions between the
client and server.

5.React js: Employed to build the frontend of the application, offering a component based architecture for
creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces React js allows for real time data updates, seamless user
interactions, and efficient component management

6.HTML and CSS: Used for structuring and styling the frontend components. HTML defines the layout and
structure of the web pages, while CSS is used to style and enhance the visual appearance of the application.

7.Git: Implemented as a version control system to track changes in the source code. It enables collaboration
among developers, facilitates code management, and supports deployment workflows.

8.Used for testing and validating the APIs developed in the project. Postman allows developers to
easily send HTTP requests to the backend, test endpoints, and ensure the correctness of the API responses.

Conclusion: 
The Data Prober project stands out as a robust and versatile tool designed to enhance data
management and analysis. By leveraging a combination of advanced technologies including Spring Boot, Spring
Data JPA, and React.js, Data Prober delivers a powerful backend and a dynamic frontend that cater to the needs
of developers, analysts, and administrators.
